# Long Rememberance

Long Rememberance (as it's called in Jamaica) is a memory card game where you try to located as many matching pairs of cards (by rank, not suit) from a spread Deck as possible.
Players alternate taking turns. During a turn a player flips two cards, if the ranks match, they gain a point, and those two cards are removed from play, the player is then given another turn.

NOTE: The code for this game was hastily written for my annual "Who can code the best game in 2 days" competition with a couple of friends!


Also, credit to @selfthinker for his css playing card code which made this possible. You can find it over on his repo at: https://github.com/selfthinker/CSS-Playing-Cards
